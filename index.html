<hr>

<p><img src="assets/images/Profile_Pic.jpg" alt="Gregory Smiling" style="float:left;width:100px;height:100px;">
    My name is Gregory; pleased to meet you! I am a fledgling web developer,
historical fencer, tabletop and video gamer, cooking enthusiast and all-
around nerd. I am 26 years old, have three siblings, and prefer dogs over cats.
Since this is not a dating profile, I won't bore you with any further personal
details; allow me to show you my professional qualifications!
</p>

<p>I graduated from Notre Dame College in 2015, with a BA in Management
Information Systems. Since then, I have been struggling to find
a good niche in the job market. It wasn't until late 2018 that I decided to
stop wasting my time doing unfulfilling work, so I turned to code. I
am very excited to see what the world of programming has to offer!
