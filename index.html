    My name is Gregory; pleased to meet you! I am a fledgling web developer,<br>
historical fencer, tabletop and video gamer, cooking enthusiast and all-<br>
around nerd. I am 26 years old, have three siblings, and prefer dogs over cats.<br>
Since this is not a dating profile, I won't bore you with any further personal<br>
details; allow me to show you my professional qualifications!
</p>

<p>I graduated from Notre Dame College in 2015, with a BA in Management
Information Systems. Since then, I have been struggling to find<br>
a good niche in the job market. It wasn't until late 2018 that I decided to
stop wasting my time doing unfulfilling work, so I turned to code. I <br>
am very excited to see what the world of programming has to offer!</p>
