            My name is Gregory; pleased to meet you! I am a fledgling web developer,
            historical fencer, tabletop and video gamer, cooking enthusiast and all-
            around nerd. I am 26 years old, have three siblings, and prefer dogs over cats.
            Since this is not a dating profile, I won't bore you with any further personal
            details; allow me to show you my professional qualifications!
        </p>

        <p>I graduated from Notre Dame College in 2015, with a BA in Management
            Information Systems. Since then, I have been struggling to find
            a good niche in the job market. It wasn't until late 2018 that I decided to
            stop wasting my time doing unfulfilling work, so I turned to code. I
            am very excited to see what the world of programming has to offer!
